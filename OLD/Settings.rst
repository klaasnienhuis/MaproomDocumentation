Settings
========

There are a few settings available in Shred. Currently you can maintain multiple repositories and get updates when they're available. Licensing is disabled at the moment. You can use the script for free.

Repository
----------

Shreds are stored in a repository. That's a folder containing an .xml file with the metadata and a .ms file for each shred. You can add and remove repositories in this settings menu. You can have only one repository activated. You can use this feature to separate your personal shreds from shreds shared across the company. Or maybe you want to separate gui code from maths.
Use the buttons on the right to add or remove a folder. Removing a folder from Shred won't delete the folder. If you pick a new or empty folder a new repo is created. If the folder you've added already contains a repo, it's read right in.

.. note:: Don't place your repository in the script installation folder. This folder is cleared once the script updates. Use a location you trust and back it up!

Update
------

Updates to Shred are stored online. The script checks for updates each time it starts up. If there's an update a popup notifies you and you can install the script directly. Typically you don't need to check for updates manually. 

License
-------

Currently the script doesn't work with a license. Future features might be introduced which will be licensed. You'll always have access to the shreds you create though.
