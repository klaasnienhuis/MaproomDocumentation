Mollweide
=========

By Karl Mollweide (1805). It's an equal area projection. This means the ratio between two areas on the globe is the same as the ratio between those same areas on the map. A good example is this ratio between Greenland and Africa. This is about 1:13.7 (Africa is 13.7 times larger than Greenland). This ratio is properly represented on a Mollweide map. When you compare this to a Mercator map it seems Greenland is larger than Africa.
