UTM
===

UTM stands for universal transverse mercator. It is a variation of the regular mercator. It is suitable for mapping of smaller regions. UTM is strictly speaking not a single projection but a projection system. With UTM the globe is sliced into 60 strips (zones). Each zone is mapped individually.
