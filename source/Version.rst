Version requirement
===================

Maproom has been confirmed to work with 3dsMax and 3dsMax design 2013 and up. I actively test Maproom on the current 3dsMax version and three versions back. For instance, the current 3dsMax version is 2017. This means I test on 3dsMax 2017 and 2016, 2015 and 2014. This does not guarantee Maproom will work on all of these versions. Some Maproom features might limit compatibility with newer 3dsMax versions.
