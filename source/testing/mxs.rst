Testing MaxScript
=================

The newer Maproom releases also come with a built in test system. This is my attempt to use some sort of test driven development approach in 3dsMax. Having these tests will certainly help me releasing a more stable Maproom while keeping adding new features.

Download the a Maproom release with tests here `testable maproom release <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/z25tbqrmmrg7obq/AAAFIaefGu0_9o1sLqGb4LKAa?dl=0>`_. Get the latest mzp-file labeled with ``TEST`` in the filename.

Test instructions
-----------------

If you've just downloaded the mzp-file, install it first (:ref:`installation`). To run the tests, go to the Maproom installation folder. That's something like this: ``C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\[3ds max version]\ENU\scripts\KlaasTools\Maproom\scriptfiles\tests``. In that folder there's a file called ``Test_root.mse``. Drag and drop this file into a 3dsMax viewport. 

While the tests are running, info is being printed out to the maxscript listener (press F11 to open it). Copy and paste this info into a text file and send it to mail@klaasnienhuis.nl.

Manual check
------------

The tests (should) also create some images in your user folder. They should be about here: ``C:\Users\[username]\Documents\3dsMax\Maproom_Test_MXS``. Please zip that entire folder and send it over too.
