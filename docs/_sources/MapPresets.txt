Map Presets
===========

Maproom comes with a few map presets to make starting a map easier. A map preset is basically a map with a number of layers. Each map preset can also be made by starting with an empty map and adding these layers yourself.

Once a map preset has been loaded you need to request the actual data by pressing the "Update..." buttons from the individual layers. This will download the actual data and make maps of them.

Satellite
---------

The Satellite preset has a single terrain layer enabled with OSMmapnik as raster source. The default settings give you a map of Berlin and its surroundings.
