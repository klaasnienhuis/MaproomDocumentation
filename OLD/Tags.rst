Tags
====

I've chosen to organize the shreds mainly with tags. This allows me to store and find back code quickly. For instance, I've created some gui elements with .net. I store it in a shred and give it a "gui" and "dotnet" tag. Or I've found something on cgTalk about sorting structs which uses bsearch, so I slap on the tags "struct", "bsearch" and "denisT". Denis always seems to write the good stuff but it's hard to find back on cgTalk. I also can add the weblink to where I've found the code.

*Clicking a tag filters the list of available shreds*

All tags are shown in a list. To find all shreds which use a specific tag I just press a tag. This filters the shreds and makes the list easier to navigate. Since I can add multiple tags to a shred, I can also filter with multiple tags. For instance: find all shreds with the "bitarray" and "polyop" tags. It's up to me to keep a sensible vocabulary of tags.

Sorting tags
------------
I can sort the tags alphabetically or by popularity. I can isolate the tags which I've selected. This comes in handy if there are lots of tags and it's difficult to see which ones have been selected.
The best feature of the tag list is that once I've selected a tag, all other tags which don't have a shred in common become unavailable. This is very useful and prevents me from clicking tags which don't relate.

Filtering tags
--------------

If the list of tags becomes very long it's convenient to filter the tags by searching for it. Type a few characters of a tag and the list is filtered. Matching tags will bubble up. I've made sure not to get punished by using many tags.
